# 📌 Maximum Frequency of an Element in an Array

## 📝 Problem Statement

The frequency of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by `1`.

Return the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most `k` operations.

## 📌 Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
```

**Output:**

```cpp
3
```

**Explanation:**\
Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make `nums = [4,4,4]`.\
4 has a frequency of `3`.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5
```

**Output:**

```cpp
2
```

**Explanation:**\
There are multiple optimal solutions:

- Increment the first element three times to make `nums = [4,4,8,13]`. 4 has a frequency of `2`.
- Increment the second element four times to make `nums = [1,8,8,13]`. 8 has a frequency of `2`.
- Increment the third element five times to make `nums = [1,4,13,13]`. 13 has a frequency of `2`.

---

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```cpp
nums = [3,9,6], k = 2
```

**Output:**

```cpp
1
```

## 🚀 Approach

The solution follows the **sliding window technique** combined with sorting:

1. **Sort the Array** - To ensure elements are in increasing order.
2. **Expand the Window** - Expand the right pointer while keeping the sum of operations within `k`.
3. **Shrink the Window** - If the required operations exceed `k`, shrink the window from the left.
4. **Update Maximum Frequency** - Track the largest valid window.

## 📌 Algorithm

1. **Sort `nums`.**
2. **Initialize the following integers:**
   - `left = 0`, the left pointer.
   - `ans = 0`, the best answer we have seen so far.
   - `curr = 0`, the sum of the elements currently in our window.
3. **Iterate `right` over the indices of `nums`:**
   - Consider `target = nums[right]`.
   - Add `target` to `curr`.
   - While the size of the window `(right - left + 1) * target - curr` is greater than `k`:
     - Subtract `nums[left]` from `curr`.
     - Increment `left`.
   - Update `ans` with the current window size if it is larger.
4. **Return `ans`.**

## 🛠️ Code Implementation (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequency(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());  // Step 1: Sort the array
        int left = 0;  // Left pointer
        int ans = 0;  // To store max frequency
        long curr = 0;  // To store the sum of elements in the current window
        
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {  // Expanding the window
            long target = nums[right];  // The number we want to make all elements equal to
            curr += target;  // Add target to the sum
            
            while ((right - left + 1) * target - curr > k) {  // If required operations exceed k, shrink the window
                curr -= nums[left];  // Remove the leftmost element
                left++;  // Move left pointer
            }
            
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1);  // Update max frequency
        }
        
        return ans;  // Return the maximum frequency found
    }
};
```
